  # Create the directory hierarchy for mongo browsering
  #
  # path can be:
  # /
  # /database_name/
  # /database_name/collection/
  # /database_name/collection/_id
  # /database_name/collection/_id/field
  #
  # This is a bit convoluted but here goes:
  #   Jquerytree requires '/' as the delimiter. So mongo has some issues with this.
  #   * database names can't have / so we are ok there
  #   * collection names can have '/', but not $, so we use the $ to escape the /'s in the collection name
  #   * The _id can be String or BSON::ObjectId which is stripped by to_s, so I added an extra path $String or $BSON::ObjectId
  #   * The _id is assumed to be everything after the type match (which is the 4th '/')
  #   * Finally, the _id name can have '/''s and $'s etc, but it can't have '.', so I use that around the key name so when it's posted it makes sense.
  #       - then take /1/2/3/type_of_id/this is the _id/.key.
  #       - take 4 slashes down to get start of _id
  #       - work updwards removing the .key.
  #       - all you got left is the id. _wheh_
